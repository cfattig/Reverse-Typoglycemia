 of the hmuan mnid.  Aoccdrnig to a rseearch taem at Cmabrigde Uinervtisy, it deos not
mttaer in waht oredr the ltteers in a wrod are, the olny iprmoatnt tihng is taht the
frist and lsat ltteer be in the rghit pclae.  The rset can be a taotl mses and
you can sitll raed it wouthit a porbelm.  Tihs is bcuseae the huamn mnid deos not
raed ervey lteter by istlef, but the wrod as a wlohe.  Such a cdonition is arppoiatrely
